This file describes the coding conventions and settings for this project, referred to as "Rules" or "Rule File".

## Most Important Rule - Process for Adding New Rules
If you receive an instruction from the user that is deemed to require consistent application rather than a one-time response:

1. Ask, "Should this be made a standard rule?"
2. If a YES response is received, add it as an additional rule to CLAUDE.md.
3. Thereafter, always apply it as a standard rule.

Through this process, we will continuously improve the project's rules.
